#1st program for calculating modulus, exponent , and floor division
a=int(input("Enter first number:"))
b=int(input("Enter second number :"))
print(f"modulus of {a} and {b} is {a%b}")
print(f" Exponent of {a} and {b} is {a**b}")
print(f" Floor Division of {a} and {b} is {a//b}")

#2nd program that use comparison operator
a=int(input("Enter first number:"))
b=int(input("Enter second number:"))
print(f"Is a equal to b (True : False): {a==b} ")
print(f"Is a  not equal to b (True :  False): {a!=b} ")
print(f"Is a is greater than b (True :  False): {a>b} ")
print(f"Is a is less than b (True :  False): {a<b} ")
print(f"Is a is greater than equal to b (True :  False): {a>=b} ")
print(f"Is a is less than equal to b (True :  False): {a<=b} ")
